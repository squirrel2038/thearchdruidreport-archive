<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the next year or so, as I’ve mentioned in recent posts, I plan on tracing out as much as possible of what can be known or reasonably guessed about the next five hundred years or so of North American history—the period of the decline and fall of the civilization that now occupies that continent, the dark age in which that familiar trajectory ends, and the first stirrings of the successor societies that will rise out of its ruins. That’s a challenging project, arguably more so than anything else I’ve attempted here, and it also involves some presuppositions that may be unfamiliar even to my regular readers. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To begin with, I’m approaching history—the history of the past as well as of the future—from a strictly ecological standpoint.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’d like to propose, in fact, that history might best be understood as the ecology of human communities, traced along the dimension of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like every other ecological process, in other words, it’s shaped partly by the pressures of the senvironment and partly by the way its own subsystems interact with one another, and with the subsystems of the other ecologies around it. That’s not a common view; most historical writing these days puts human beings<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>at the center of the picture, with the natural world as a supposedly static background, while a minority view goes to the other extreme and fixates on natural catastrophes as the sole cause of this or that major historical change. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Neither of these approaches seem particularly useful to me. As our civilization has been trying its level best not to learn for the last couple of centuries, and thus will be learning the hard way in the years immediately ahead, the natural world is not a static background. It’s an active and constantly changing presence that responds in complex ways to human actions. Human societies, in turn, are equally active and equally changeable, and respond in complex ways to nature’s actions. The strange loops generated by a dance of action and interaction along these lines are difficult to track by the usual tools of linear thinking, but they’re the bread and butter of systems theory, and also of all those branches of ecology that treat the ecosystem rather than the individual organism as the basic unit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The easiest way to show how this perspective works is to watch it in action, and it so happens that one of the most important factors that will shape the history of North America over the next five centuries is particularly amenable to a systems analysis. The factor I have in mind is climate.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course that’s also a political hot potato just at the moment, due to the unwillingness of a great many people across the industrial world to deal with the hard fact that they can’t continue to enjoy their current lifestyles if they want a climatically and ecologically stable planet to live on. It doesn’t matter how often the planet sets new heat records, nor that the fabled Northwest Passage around the top end of Canada—which has been choked with ice since the beginning of recorded history—is open water every summer nowadays, and an increasingly important route for commercial shipping from Europe to the eastern shores of Asia; every time the planet’s increasingly chaotic weather spits out unseasonably cold days in a few places, you can count on hearing well-paid flacks and passionate amateurs alike insisting at the top of their lungs that this proves that anthropogenic climate change is nonsense. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To the extent that this reaction isn’t just propaganda, it shows a blindness to systems phenomena <a href=../../2011/02/overcoming-systems-stupidity.html>I’ve discussed here before</a>: a learned inability to recognize that change in complex systems does not follow the sort of nice straight lines our current habits of thought prefer. A simple experiment can help show how complex systems respond in the real world, and in the process make it easier to make sense of the sort of climate phenomena we can count on seeing in the decades ahead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The next time you fill a bathtub, once you’ve turned off the tap, wait until the water is still. Slip your hand into the water, slowly and gently, so that you make as little disturbance in the water as possible. Then move your hand through the water about as fast as a snail moves, and watch and feel how the water adapts to the movement, flowing gently around your hand. . </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once you’ve gotten a clear sense of that, gradually increase the speed with which your hand is moving. After you pass a certain threshold of speed, the movements of the water will take the form of visible waves—a bow wave in front of your hand, a wake behind it in which water rises and falls rhythmically, and wave patterns extending out to the edges of the tub. The faster you move your hand, the larger the waves become, and the more visible the interference patterns as they collide with one another. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Keep on increasing the speed of your hand. You’ll pass a second threshold, and the rhythm of the waves will disintegrate into turbulence: the water will churn, splash, and spray around your hand, and chaotic surges of water will lurch up and down the sides of the tub. If you keep it up, you can get a fair fraction of the bathwater on your bathroom floor, but this isn’t required for the experiment! Once you’ve got a good sense of the difference between the turbulence above the second threshold and the oscillations below it, take your hand out of the water, and watch what happens: the turbulence subsides into wave patterns, the waves shrink, and finally—after some minutes—you have still water again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This same sequence of responses can be traced in every complex system, governing its response to every kind of disturbance in its surroundings. So long as the change stays below a certain threshold of intensity and rapidity—a threshold that differs for every system and every kind of change—the system will respond smoothly, with the least adjustment that will maintain its own internal balance. Once that threshold is surpassed, oscillations of various kinds spread through the system, growing steadily more extreme as the disturbance becomes stronger, until it passes the second threshold and the system’s oscillations collapse into turbulence and chaos. When chaotic behavior begins to emerge in an oscillating system, in other words, that’s a sign that real trouble may be sitting on the doorstep. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If global temperature were increasing in a nice even line, in other words, we wouldn’t have as much to worry about, because it would be clear from that fact that the resilience of the planet’s climate system was well able to handle the changes that were in process. Once things begin to oscillate, veering outside usual conditions in both directions, that’s a sign that the limits to resilience are coming into sight, with the possibility of chaotic variability in the planetary climate as a whole waiting not far beyond that. We can fine-tune the warning signals a good deal by remembering that every system is made up of subsystems, and those of sub-subsystems, and as a general rule of thumb, the smaller the system, the more readily it moves from local adjustment to oscillation to turbulence in response to rising levels of disturbance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Local climate is sensitive enough, in fact, that ordinary seasonal changes can yield minor turbulence, which is why the weather is so hard to predict; regional climates are more stable, and normally cycle through an assortment of wavelike oscillations; the cycle of the seasons is one, but there are also multiyear and multidecade cycles of climate that can be tracked on a regional basis. It’s when those regional patterns start showing chaotic behavior—when, let’s say, the usually sizzling Texas summer is suddenly broken by a record cold snap in the middle of July, in a summer that’s shaping up globally to be among the hottest ever measured—that you know the whole system is coming under strain. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<a href=http://www.kltv.com/story/26058367/48-hours-for-the-weather-record-books-in-east-texas>Ahem.</a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m not generally a fan of Thomas Friedman, but he scored a direct hit when he warned that what we have to worry about from anthropogenic climate change is not global warming but "global weirding:" in the terms I’ve used in this post, the emergence of chaotic shifts out of a global climate that’s been hit with too much disturbance too fast. A linear change in global temperatures would be harsh, but it would be possible to some extent to shift crop belts smoothly north in the northern hemisphere and south in the southern. If the crop belts disintegrate—if you don’t know whether the next season is going to be warm or cold, wet or dry, short or long—famines become hard to avoid, and cascading impacts on an already strained global economy add to the fun and games.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At this point, for the reasons just shown, that’s the most likely shape of the century or two ahead of us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In theory, some of that could be avoided if the world’s nations were to stop treating the skies as an aerial sewer in which to dump greenhouse gases. In practice—well, I’ve met far too many climate change activists who still insist that they have to have SUVs to take their kids to soccer practice, and I recall the embarrassed silence that spread a while back when an important British climate scientist pointed out that maybe jetting all over the place to climate conferences was communicating the wrong message at a time when climate scientists and everyone else needed to decrease their carbon footprint. Until the people who claim to be concerned about climate change start showing a willingness to burn much less carbon, it’s unlikely that anyone else will do so, and so I think it’s a pretty safe bet that fossil fuels will continue to be extracted and burnt as long as geological and economic realities permit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The one bleak consolation here is that those realities are a good deal less flexible than worst-case scenarios generally assume. There are two factors in particular to track here, and both unfold from net energy—the difference between the energy content of fossil fuels as they reach the end consumer and the energy input needed to get them all the way there. The first factor is simply that if a deposit of fossil carbon takes more energy to extract, process, and transport to the end user than the end user can get by burning it, the fossil carbon will stay in the ground. The poster child here is kerogen shale, which has been the bane of four decades of enthusiastic energy projects in the American West and elsewhere. There’s an immense amount of energy locked up in the Green River shale and its equivalents, but every attempt to break into that cookie jar has come to grief on the hard fact that, all things considered, it takes more energy to extract kerogen from shale than you get from burning the kerogen. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second factor is subtler and considerably more damaging. As fossil fuel deposits with abundant net energy are exhausted, and have to be replaced by deposits with lower net energy, a larger and larger fraction of the total energy supply available to an industrial society has to be diverted from all other economic uses to the process of keeping the energy flowing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus it’s not enough to point to high total energy production and insist that all’s well; the logic of net energy has to be applied here as well, and the total energy input to energy production, processing, and distribution subtracted from total energy production, to get a realistic sense of how much energy is available to power the rest of the economy—and the rest of the economy, remember, is what produces the wealth that makes it possible for individuals, communities, and nations to afford fossil fuels in the first place.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Long before the last physically extractable deposit of fossil fuel is exhausted, in other words, fossil fuel extraction will have to stop because it’s become an energy sink rather than an energy source. Well before that point is reached, furthermore, the ability of global and national economies to meet the energy costs of fossil fuel extraction will slam face first into hard limits. Demand destruction, which is what economists call the process by which people who can’t afford to buy a product stop using it, is as important here as raw physical depletion; as economies reel under the twin burdens of depleting reserves and rising energy costs for energy production, carbon footprints will shrink willy-nilly as rapid downward mobility becomes the order of the day for most people. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Combine these factors with the economic impacts of "global weirding" itself and you’ve got a good first approximation of the forces that are already massing to terminate the fossil fuel economy with extreme prejudice in the decades ahead. How those are likely to play out the future we’re facing will be discussed at length in several future posts. For the time being, I’ll just note that I expect global fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions to peak within a decade or so to either side of 2030, and then tip over into a ragged and accelerating decline, punctuated by economic and natural disasters, that will reach the zero point of the scale well before 2100. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What that means for the future climate of North America is difficult to predict in detail but not so hard to trace in outline. From now until the end of the 21st century, perhaps longer, we can expect climate chaos, accelerating in its geographical spread and collective impact until a couple of decades after CO2 emissions peak, due to the lag time between when greenhouse gases hit the atmosphere and when their effects finally peak. As the rate of emissions slows thereafter, the turbulence will gradually abate, and some time after that—exactly when is anybody’s guess, but 2300 or so is as good a guess as any—the global climate will have settled down into a "new normal" that won’t be normal by our standards at all. Barring further curveballs from humanity or nature, that "new normal" will remain until enough excess CO2 has been absorbed by natural cycles to matter—a process that will take several millennia at least, and therefore falls outside the range of the five centuries or so I want to consider here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
An educated guess at the shape of the "new normal" is possible, because for the last few million years or so, the paleoclimatology of North America has shown a fairly reliable pattern. The colder North America has been, by and large, the heavier the rainfall in the western half of the continent. During the last Ice Age, for example, rainfall in what’s now the desert Southwest was so heavy that it produced a chain of huge pluvial (that is, rain-fed) lakes and supported relatively abundant grassland and forest ecosystems across much of what’s now sagebrush and cactus country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some measure of the difference can be caught from the fact that 18,000 years ago, when the last Ice Age was at its height, Death Valley was a sparkling lake surrounded by pine forests. By contrast, the warmer North America becomes, the dryer the western half of the continent gets, and the drying effect spreads east a very long ways. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
After the end of the last Ice Age, for example, the world entered what nowadays gets called the Holocene Climatic Optimum; that term’s a misnomer, at least for this continent, because conditions over a good bit of North America then were optimum only for sand fleas and Gila monsters. There’s been a running debate for several decades about whether the Hypsithermal, to use the so-called Optimum’s other name, was warmer than today all over the planet or just in some regions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Current opinion tends to favor the latter, but the difference doesn’t actually have that much impact on the issue we’re considering:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the evidence from a broad range of sources shows that North America was significantly warmer in the Hypsithermal than it is today, and so that period makes a fairly good first approximation of the conditions this continent is likely to face in a warmer world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To make sense of the long-term change to North American climates, it’s important to remember that rainfall is far more important than temperature as a determining factor for local ecosystems. If a given region gets more than about 40 inches of rain a year, no matter what the temperature, it’ll normally support some kind of forest; if it gets between 40 and 10 inches a year, you’ve got grassland or, in polar regions, mosses and lichens; if you get less than 10 inches a year, you’ve got desert, whether it’s as hot as the Sahara or as bitterly cold as the Takla Makan. In the Hypsithermal, as the west dried out,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>tallgrass prairie extended straight across the Midwest to western Pennsylvania, and much of the Great Plains were desert, complete with sand dunes.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In a world with ample fossil fuel supplies, it’s been possible to ignore such concerns, to the extent of pumping billions of gallons of water a year from aquifers or distant catchment basins to grow crops in deserts and the driest of grasslands, but as fossil fuel supplies sunset out, the shape of human settlement will once again be a function of annual rainfall, as it was everywhere on the planet before 1900 or so. If the Hypsithermal’s a valid model, as seems most likely, most of North America from the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges east across the Great Basin and Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains will be desert, as inhospitable as any on Earth, and human settlement will be accordingly sparse: scattered towns in those few places where geology allows a permanent water supply, separated by vast desolate regions inhabited by few hardy nomads or by no one at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
East of the Great Desert, grassland will extend for a thousand miles or more, east to the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Allegheny foothills, north to a thinner and dryer boreal forest belt shifted several hundred miles closer to the Arctic Ocean, and south to the tropical jungles of the Gulf coast. Further south, in what’s now Mexico, the tropical rain belt will move northwards with shifts in the global atmospheric circulation, and the Gulf coast east of the Sierra Madre Oriental will shift to tropical ecosystems all the way north to, and beyond, the current international border. Between the greatly expanded tropical zone in the south and east and the hyperarid deserts of the north, Mexico will be a land of sharp ecological contrasts</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Factor in sea level rise, on the one hand, and the long-term impacts of soil depletion and of toxic and radioactive wastes on the other—issues complicated enough in their causes, trajectory, and results that they’re going to require separate posts—and you’ve got a fairly limited set of regions in which agriculture will be possible in a post-fossil fuel environment: basically, the eastern seaboard from the new coast west to the Alleghenies and the Great Lakes, and river valleys in the eastern half of the Mississippi basin. The midwestern grasslands will support pastoral grazing, and the jungle belts around the new Gulf coast and across southern Mexico will be suitable for tropical crops once the soil has a chance to recover, but the overall human carrying capacity of the continent will be significantly smaller than it was before the industrial age began.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Climate isn’t the only force pushing in that direction, either. We’ll get to the others in the weeks ahead as we continue exploring the deindustrial landscapes of dark age America.</div>

My suggestion was to ally with any advocates of mass transit, which would reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and energy use of all the riders.

Searching for more information on the Hypsithermal regarding South America I found conditions very familiar to someone who is watching climate changes around these parts: climatic belts shifted southward 5 to 10 degrees of latitude. To Brazil, that means:<br><br>- Regions in and around the Amazon drying. I've seen stunning photos of boats stranded in dried mud and a study showing how more frequent dry spells kill more and more trees and don't allow the canopy to recover fast enough, turning the forest slowly into a savanna.<br><br>- The NE of Brazil turns from semi-arid to desert. We just had a roughly 3 year dry spell in this region and it was a whooper. It gave me a very good idea of how bad it can get, and we have a long way to go. After going through one of these, and I live in one of the parts that were least affected, you just learn the hard way to really, really value water. <br><br>- The southern regions getting more humid, with slighly greater rainfall. That seems like a good thing until you look at all the floodings that cover small cities almost completly, and they have been more frequent for a while now.<br><br>A useful abstract here:<br>https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/inqu/finalprogram/abstract_54305.htm<br><br>Cheers!<br><br><a href=#c3736895149310306984 title="comment permalink">7/30/14, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>

It's a very simple approach - apply what we know from the past (history, prehistory, paleoclimate, etc) and realize that we're still on the same planet, with the same laws of physics, and that we're still the same people as our preindustrial ancestors, so broadly speaking both human and natural systems are likely to respond in ways similar to their past responses. Now if only I could somehow find a time machine or a longevity potion and see if you're right...<br><br>I just made a crude spreadsheet in Excel to see what type of CO2 concentration we might peak at under the assumption that the rate of change of the CO2 concentration peaks around 2030, falling to 0 by 2100. Under my model, the CO2 concentration rises by 0.55% this year (roughly equal to its average growth rate over the last decade) and the growth rate increases by 0.01% per year from now until 2029 (at 0.7%/year), then falls by 0.01%/year until it bottoms out at 0 by 2099.<br><br>The peak concentration under these assumptions is "only" 562 ppm, obviously reached in 2099, conveniently about double the preindustrial level where temperatures were 0.8 C cooler than present. If the mean of most model estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity is correct, we see about 3 C/doubling. So under these really crude assumptions, we've got a world 2.2 C warmer than present. Of course the error bars are huge, and they're larger on the warmer side. But if this is roughly where we end up, we're in the mid-Pliocene warm period at about 3.3 Ma, or perhaps a little worse. This is inconvenient because sea levels were 25 m higher than present, with no West Antarctic ice sheet and little or no Greenland ice sheet, but the East Antarctic ice sheet still existed and contained most of its current mass.<br><br>So we fall back down to Earth again after a very messy transition, and it's an Earth warmer than it's been for at least 3 million years and with very different coastlines and biomes. Overall I think I agree with you - there's reason to be optimistic that human civilization will survive the next 500 years, albeit in a dark age not unlike the one in Star's Reach. We might even get to keep the land between 25-80 m above current sea level!<br><br>The more I think about it, the more it becomes difficult to imagine that we're anything but a bizarrely energy-rich (and proportionately disruptive) civilization in a long line of cultures that have risen and fallen before us and will do so long after us. It's baffling to me that I would have had trouble even imagining this only a few years ago, but now it seems like the only reasonable type of assumption.<br><br><a href=#c1615742649609863143 title="comment permalink">7/30/14, 6:57 PM</a><br><br>

It is hilly country, and had many lakes and forests that caused the right temperature level to allow perennially precipitation. Then some fool when and built a city of 10 million people there. The lakes were drained and filled out to make high end housing. Now the weather there is as bad as everywhere in India. There used to be 50,000 lakes in Bangalore, now there are 15,000. <br><br>The funny thing is, and I don't think most people realize this, is that majority of those 50,000 lakes were artificial. The tribes that lived there started digging them over 500 years ago (maybe longer) to help improve agriculture and provide fish. It was a specular feat of geo-engineering.

That may keep some of the favored mountain ranges in the southwest from becoming desert if it happens that way again this time. Other human impacts may work against that, however, land degradation in northern Mexico leads to less transpiration and therefore possibly less moisture in the monsoon.<br><br>Sea level rise flooding the Central Valley of California may eventually have a major impact too, the shallow sea will heat up in the summer and may add considerably to the monsoon.<br><br>Closer to where I am, what little I could find shows that there may have been a sharp gradient in dryness in Missouri/Arkansas. Some places in eastern Arkansas were shown to be wetter than was supposed, while there is evidence of desert vegetation in parts of NW Arkansas. However, I wonder how widespread the desert vegetation really was. The ozarks already has glades where there is very thin soil, usually on south or southwest facing slopes, a somewhat drier and hotter climate could turn those into deserts but still leave areas with more soil capable of growing forests. There are isolated populations of Beech and Umbrella Magnolia in northwest Arkansas as well, there must have been enough moist woods at least in patches to support them through the dry period.<br><br><a href=#c8414776685271240714 title="comment permalink">7/30/14, 8:41 PM</a><br><br>

This in turn has increased evaporation and the prevailing winds - which incidentally also have increased energy - are flowing over the continent from the NW and dumping significant amounts of rainfall especially in the SE. However, this has meant that the north of the continent outside of the tropical zones along the northern coastline, are in drought.

How come I'm not surprised that you're already fielding denialist screeds?<br><br>As I've watched the latest figures roll in, the hottest May on record, probably June and July too, some extreme weirdnesses in places, a phrase keeps scrolling across my internal ticker tape, ready for the next denialist to cross my path: "How's that 'hiatus'-y, 'halt'-y thing doin' for ya now?" I have visions of the massed cherrypickers of the fossil-fuel lobby and 'free market' 'think' tanks working overtime trying to find some new out-of-context data point to illustrate how things are doing just fine.<br><br>Over the past few decades I've taken my place on the battle lines in most of the theatres where the environmental skirmishes have been occurring. Yes, I've been a government advisor (ok, in a very small jurisdiction ;-) ), I've done the liaising with industry to try and make them friends instead of enemies, I've done the bucaneering direct actions in inflatable boats, I've grown and sold certified organic produce and fitted renewables for a living. Every one of them has involved compromise somewhere along the line, whether it has been jetting around the world or putting on a suit and having a shave! The reactions I've faced have included watercannons, machineguns, detention, and indignant letters to the editor. In short, people do not want to change in the only way that will work - which is to embrace LESS. The really committed might accept electric cars, but balk at fewer cars. They look for 'alternative' energy, but resist using less energy. They want 'green growth', but won't consider de-growth. At times I've burned out and declared defeat. Sometimes, I've seen positive results, but by about 2003-4 I concluded that climate change was unstoppable. <br><br>People say that personal restraint is pointless because other people won't reduce their consumption too. But even if it's a drop in the ocean, well, the ocean is just a critical mass of drops. Just as climate change is a critical mass of people using too much fossil-fuelled energy in their individual lives. So, my green activism these days is mostly enacted in my lifestyle - in my garden, my energy use, my travel and consumption. I haven't been on a plane for over 10 years now, and though I still have a car (it's a useful tool, after all), my mileage is about 500 m/year. I walk much more than that. As a long-time proponent of organic growing and permaculture, I often hear the question 'But can it feed the world?' That's the wrong question, it's not my responsibility to feed the world, but I do get a long way towards feeding myself, which is something 99% of the advocates of GMO/industrial/chemical agriculture cannot do.<br><br>So, absolutely, those who want to see less carbon used must use less themselves, and the same applies across all forms of consumption. Leading by example has to be a big part of the effort. I do believe Gandhi had a pithy saying about that principle.<br><br><a href=#c8418263820166087363 title="comment permalink">7/31/14, 4:29 AM</a><br><br>

To them it is something only crazy people talk about."<br><br>That's probably the same here in the UK, but to add another observation - whilst people do not talk about 'social collapse' explicitly, they just give it another name. Whether it's 'immigrants', 'unconstitutional', 'seperatists', 'the squeezed middle', 'cost of living crisis' or '1%ers', the language may not be that of social collapse, but I think people are aware of it (if only subconsciously) and trying to frame it in a way which jibes with their existing world-view/political agenda. A limited acceptance is a degree of denial - by accepting the 'lesser' evil of people find it easier to gloss over the wider implications of the big picture. <br><br>That's my big fear, politically: when people do notice something is wrong, how they react and what they propose is so filtered through an inappropriate narrative that they could well go off the deep end - which brings us back to the roots of fascism etc, if I may be permitted to Godwin myself ;-)<br><br><a href=#c4277453295237935535 title="comment permalink">7/31/14, 4:53 AM</a><br><br>

I see no reason, now that we're in this Easter Island Bind, why we won't burn, burn, burn anything that we can find. On top of mere carbon output, we'll be destroying one of our best means of natural carbon sequestration, adding further ripples to the climate bathtub. <br><br>The soil-destroying, salinization, desertification and other consequences of a massive deforestation will also have a major impact on the carrying capacity of the continent and planet...<br><br><a href=#c7543039517455414762 title="comment permalink">7/31/14, 6:17 AM</a><br><br>

(Since my World Dynamics/Limits to Growth experience in the '70's.) I actually gave it a 15-year tolerance in my mind, which means we're already entering the relevant period.

I'm about two years into the implementation of a permaculture/agroforestry system in a couple of sites in the Atlantic Rainforest of southern Brazil. (Our equivalent of the Appalachians.) I know you're not very positive toward permaculture, but what draws me toward it (and agroforestry in particular) is that it relies on systems that are more resilient to years of drought, odd summers with cooler over cast days, winters that are either too cold, too wet, not cold enough, etc. In each of these cases, a mixed forest ecosystem is more likely to give you <i>some</i> yield than field crops. <br>That said, I'm also using a prediction similar to that of Atilio Baroni Filho (thanks for the link) and the "bracketing" approach stolen from photography.

I wonder if our dumping carbon in the atmosphere blew this pattern of glaciation/glacial recession off course. <br><br>According to the bits that I've read on this topic, the last two million years have been characterized by long stretches of severe cold/glaciation (ie several million cubic miles of glacial ice), interspersed with stretches of warm with each warm period lasting maybe ten thousand years. <br><br>Again ,according to what I've read, this repetition of glacial advance/glacial recession happened in synch with wobbles in the Earth's position in space with respect to the sun, which, in turn, affected the amount of solar energy the Earth received. "Nutation" I think this pattern is called. <br><br>If this is so (I'm probably grotesquely oversimplifying) and if patterns of glaciation and glacial recession can be forecast by means of these predictable astronomic changes, then we ought to be able to say with a certain degree of accuracy when we would expect the next glacial onset. Can we rely on astronomic and geologic history? <br><br>Now, keep in mind that mostly what I know is what I read in the papers. So maybe these burblings sound hopelessly naive and childish. <br><br>I'm reading that we're in the latest inter-glacial period. It's been a good ten thousand years of warm climate. So are we reaching the end of it? What do the astronomers say? <br><br>Maybe this dumping of carbon in the air via our agricultural/industrial way of life acts to offset what we would otherwise get, that is, over a period of coming decades/centuries, an increasingly cold Earth, glacial advance, destruction of our agricultural breadbaskets, mass starvation, mass migration. Very bad stuff IOW. <br><br>So, I'm wondering,did our treatment of the atmosphere as an aerial sewer inadvertently act to ameliorate the next, otherwise inevitable, glacial advance? Or did it act to stop the next glacial period in its tracks? I'm curious, has there been any public discussion of this by the scientific community? Because, if there has been, I totally missed it. <br><br>Which, in your opinion, is the worse scenario 1) global cooling and glacial advance or 2) world climate warmed and de-stabilized by human activity but glacial advance averted? Or are these two alternative scenarios foolishly simplistic?<br><br><a href=#c6409286698338395193 title="comment permalink">7/31/14, 10:15 AM</a><br><br>

Our overall rainfall is increasing, and likely to continue to do, but in more extreme events than in the past. This is not incompatible with the spread of prairies. <br><br>What would be interesting to see is the future plant species mix that will make up those prairies and savannas, what with all the new species that have come from elsewhere. Also interesting would be what wildlife would adapt and what would migrate in. I can imagine many animals such as bison, deer, black bears, beaver, etc. doing ok, especially as human populations decline.

The NWS bases its climate normals on a 30 year period.

How long that will be the case I don't know. Within my lifetime - I'm 57 now - climate weirding in the hotter and drier direction seems most likely but with the potential of late spring freezes and early fall freezes perhaps having more of an impact on my gardening. However, the impact of refugees from elsewhere may make more of a difference to me personally than climate weirding does.

First of all I think it likely we will keep drilling and using oil even after the return goes negative. Two reasons - first the battery. The EROEI on a battery is like 11:1 (I may have that backwards but it takes 11 times more energy to make a battery then it give off). But we still use them because the energy is in a handy form. The same is true of oil. It's liquid compact nature is very handy for transporting and running machinery. I think we will burn just about anything we can to keep producing the oil we need to run our machines for as long as we can. In addition, there is a little thing called "government subsidy". It might be that the government papers over the negative EROEI by making everyone pay a bit to cover the shortfall. They might argue that there is a huge amount of oil to be found in the "new" Arctic region and that this subsidy is just temporary until we can get that fuel. And, as Lucky said, we are likely to burn anything we can to keep the energy going - trees, coal, garbage, peat moss, etc. Heck we might even try to "mine" methane clathrates. In the end, of course, it will wind down but we could extend the damage by a good piece.<br><br><a href=#c1421777297829078437 title="comment permalink">7/31/14, 2:06 PM</a><br><br>

It'll be interesting, in something like the sense of the apocryphal Chinese curse, to see how that works out. <br><br>M, good. One of these days I'm going to write a biography of the planet Earth, which will use that all-time-is-a-year image, but extend it out into the future to the best current estimate of the end of Earth's biosphere. I think it'll drive home the point even more forcefully if all of human history is a few moments of an afternoon in early September...<br><br>Mortal, we'll be talking about topsoil loss and the like in the near future. Even if you burnt all the wood on the planet, though, that would only account for a small portion of the excess CO2 we're adding from fossil fuels, so that's less of a worry. Also, one way or another, once human population crashes -- and of course it will -- green plants will start filling in the gaps we've made, and so any last-minute carbon spike will be partly balanced by absorption into the biosphere. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Bob, fair enough; I'll look into that. <br><br>Kleymo, thanks for the suggestions!<br><br>Unknown, if so, you might want to go somewhere else, since everyone else will be stampeding toward that refuge. <br><br>Jim, if all that's left is a trickle that's hugely expensive to extract, very likely it won't be extracted.

You get this afternoon's gold star, for thinking about the systems implications of all this. It's exactly the convergence of multiple trends -- destabilizing climate, rising sea levels, disintegrating infrastructure, political and economic failure, etc., etc. -- that makes the process of decline and fall unstoppable. More, much more, on this as we proceed. <br><br>Jose, my doubts about permaculture are almost entirely a matter of the way that permaculture is being marketed in the US -- if you're actually doing the work, rather than sitting at a keyboard telling everybody they've got nothing to worry about because we'll all be fed from food forests any day now, I have no objections. <br><br>Dennis, exactly.

I'm pleased to say that both the cheerleaders for the nuclear industry and the "by-2030-we're-all-going-to-DIIIEE!" brigade will be equally offended by that post; stay tuned. <br><br>Unknown, we'll deal with that when it's time to talk about the nomadic pastoralists of the deindustrial prairies. <br><br>Eric, yes, and we'll get to that too. It's an important issue, and one that human beings can influence rather significantly in the decades and centuries ahead. <br><br>Rider, we're lost. Now that that's settled, we have to figure out which way to go from here. <br><br>Roger, don't confuse short-term climatic events (such as greenhouse gas spikes) with long-term events (such as ice ages). Yes, we'll get a new ice age eventually, probably within a few millennia -- that is, about the time the excess CO2 we're putting into the atmosphere finally gets cycled out. The most likely result, in fact, is that we've set up our descendants to be whipsawed by future climate change, as the earth moves rapidly from too hot to too cold, and the excess carbon that might have cushioned the transition was burnt in our time. <br><br>Autumn, oh, no question, the bathroom floor is already swimming.

Natural history and the earth sciences have been a source of fascination for me since I was a little boy.<br><br>http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nerc.html<br><br>Varun, Janet and others: I am currently reading “The Biggest Estate on Earth” by Bill Gammage, which discusses how the Australian aborigines actively managed the landscape and how things started to fall apart as the tribes were decimated. John Michell pointed out in “The New View Over Atlantis” that the aborigines had a system of sacred geometry, landscaping and eco-engineering that was very similar to that of the Chinese and the Neolithic peoples of Western Europe and actively managed the lands with an eye towards preserving the harmony and fertility of the land and that once the indigenous tribes began to die off and could no longer maintain their traditional system of land management, the fertility of the land began to die as well. <br><br>Thomas Mann discusses how many of the Native American cultures also managed the lands that they lived in. One thing that early European explorers in both Oz and the New World noted was how park-like and beautiful the landscapes were. This was true in many areas, including California, the Pacific Northwest, the Eastern Woodlands, the Midwest and the Amazon Basin. Later European settlers in North America found vast, overgrown forests in the Eastern part of the continent and the same thing happened in large areas of South America. This was because once most of the native tribes had been wiped out by disease, there was no one left to manage the land and the trees and brush grew back with a vengeance. There is even some evidence that the Little Ice Age was caused at least in part by the dieoff of the natives during the century or so after first contact and the sudden and rapid growth of vegetation that resulted, particularly the return of the great forests, which drew massive amounts of CO2 out of the atmosphere and nearly triggered a premature return to the next glaciation. <br><br>It is truly amazing and sad how much the Faustian civilization of the West has destroyed and disrupted in its blind ignorance, arrogance and short sightedness. But one must not forget the great things and discoveries that were achieved as well. The world would be a much poorer place today, and not merely in a materialistic sense, without the great scientific discoveries and inventions of the last several centuries, the invention of intellectual tools like the Scientific Method and great works of art and music like the operas of Mozart and Wagner. I hope that at least some of the worthier legacies of the Western world can be preserved during the coming Dark Age or recovered afterwards.

In this case, the research was motivated by a desire for economic independence and reduced vulnerability to pressure from foreign enemies, but I wonder if something similar could be developed as the Gasoline Age fades away, perhaps even on a DIY/backyard chemistry basis. One advantage of bio-plastics is that they are generally biodegradable as well.

Whenever it's very hot here, my ability to care for the yard and animals decreases and something gets ignored - and that will impact the future, as some plant doesn't produce as much, etc. And if I have an emergency (or a stupid neighbor issuing civil suits, as I do now) my money and attention suddenly swerves, and the plans to systematically deal with other things gets derailed. So the economic, ecological, energy systems all interact constantly - and of course I didn't even mention the "external inputs" like sudden heat waves, thunderstorms or medical issues. It's always a complex juggling - yet it's true that those who are in denial about climate and the slow collapse are also usually denying their own "ecology" - trying to throw money at problems rather than looking at causes and interactions.<br><br>And since my own Peak Energy has hit and I'm in decline, I notice that whereas in my 20's I used to do things "after work" simply to work off all the energy I had, now I'm dredging up the hard to get stuff, and there's dang little left over to "waste" on "fun" (my fun these days most often is reading or sitting watching Nature).

It'll have something to do with the fact that although we do have over 400 nuclear plants around the world, and that it's quite unlikely that many of them will be shut down "properly" or that their waste will be stored in some way that won't leak out within the next several centuries (to say nothing about geological timescales).<br><br>But, despite the very high radiation load, life continues. Taking the region around Chernobyl for reference, despite enormous ecological devastation and unknown number (or even order of magnitude, probably 10^4 or 10^5, but nobody knows for sure) of human fatalities, the local ecosystem is doing better than any other nearby region of Ukraine+Belarus+western Russia, to say nothing of "affluent" Western locations. Fukushima will probably settle into the same situation as well; ionizing radiation is bad for life, but if a release of radioactive materials scares off humans that aren't willing to take much higher mortality rates to live there, the local ecosystem is likely to do better than it would with constant pressure from those modern resource-rich humans.<br><br>I also have one small nit to pick with your projections of future biomes - the amount of precipitation needed to generate forests, vs grassland, vs desert, is quite dependent on local temperatures. This is only because evaporation rates are very temperature-dependent - 10 in of melted snow is worth far more at 60 N than 10 in of rain at the equator because of higher evaporation. Most taiga forests get less than 25 in (near the tundra line, it's usually less than 10 in) of rain but still manage to support impressive amounts of biomass per unit area.<br><br>This is of course less important within the contiguous United States since most of the landmass is in latitudes where your precipitation limits are a good rule of thumb for what future biomes we can expect to be present (roughly 30 to 50 N).<br><br><a href=#c6755044457272217590 title="comment permalink">8/1/14, 2:13 AM</a><br><br>

The photos of the surrounding hills around Yakima showing denuded vegetation are a dead giveaway for the low annual rainfall. The temperature extremes there could be modified with better and more established vegetation. Just sayin...<br><br>Also, the actions that were taken by governments to avoid the second Great Depression in 2008 were quite good. Unfortunately, they just don't know what to do next. I read an interesting lecture recently from the Reserve Bank governor here and can link to it if you’d like. It was clear to me that they'd adopted correct responses based on historical accounts of the 1929 stock market crash, but understanding the bigger picture seemed to be a very big ask for central bankers. They probably have no wish to go too far back when referring to historical accounts because obviously: “this time it’s different” (sarcasm alert).<br><br>Hi Les,<br><br>I feel for your situation. You may also remember that Sydney is also in the grip of an unprecedented hot and dry spell and the dams there are draining. Two years ago, it didn't rain here in any significant way for 5 months - during summer too.<br><br>I too feel your pain and don't really know what the answer is. Australia is simply the canary in the coal mine and we receive the worst of all weather conditions. All I do know is to re-mineralise your soils and plants and get more water into the ground when it falls from the sky again - as it will at some stage in the future. That will most likely happen about the exact same time that it stops raining here.

Neither of these approaches seem particularly useful to me."<br><br>Actually, properly used and understood, it is very useful, and even leads to insights into chaotic behaviour like those you brought out.<br><br>It may be easier to bring out with a couple of real life examples, electric motors and hydraulic pumping systems. Each has two very different processes working together, the electrical and mechanical sides of the motor and the liquid and its pump in a hydraulic system. It is straightforward to analyse the motor by pretending that it is rotating at a constant speed - even though we know perfectly well that it really isn't - and then solving the electrical equations for voltage and current and so on under that faulty assumption, using the mechanical side as a fixed constant. That gives us the electrical behaviour as a function of the mechanical behaviour. Then we plug that function into the equations for the mechanical side to provide the torque etc., this time treating the "constant" input to the function as a varying parameter, and we solve for that. This works because the electrical side responds and settles down so much faster than the mechanical side that near enough is good enough even though it isn't actually true.<br><br>On the other hand, that simplifying assumption fails with many hydraulic systems, because that difference of responsiveness doesn't hold - which is why you can get hammering in plumbing at odd times and under odd loads - loads that take it away from zones in which hammering was engineered out, which is the analogue of the issues you are looking into. Dealing with that literally is rocket science, because precisely that problem comes up with liquid fuelled rockets.<br><br>How is that useful, when it sounds as though I've just told you it only works in some kinds of systems and not others, and the problem at hand isn't the former sort? Because knowing why and how it works, when it does work, tells us what to look out for and when to try other things instead. That is just precisely why the better sort of economist makes simplified models with unrealistic assumptions; it's not quite to try to get forecasts, it's to use the times that it works to show what doesn't matter and can safely be abstracted out - and the times that it doesn't work to highlight what is and isn't crucial, to see what else should be studied. Similarly, the failure modes of oversimplification - bifurcations increasing towards chaos and so forth - are what tells us what to look out for in ecologies and such like. (There's a lot more that could be said as well, but that should be enough.)<br><br>By the way, I think you've missed a lot of the point people were trying to bring out about how EROI works out and is likely to work out. If they don't clarify it first themselves, I'll try doing it later myself.<br><br><a href=#c7932188315146229779 title="comment permalink">8/1/14, 4:09 AM</a><br><br>

I used to keep detailed weather records going back 40-45 years, though I haven't kept up with it for many years.<br><br>The first change I noticed was a lengthening of the growing season, beginning, I would say, in the 1980s. Killing frosts used to be normal by the middle of October, but that date has slipped by two-three weeks. I remember one year in the 1980s we didn't have a frost until nearly Thanksgiving. Last killing frosts in the spring have shifted from mid- to late April to, sometimes, as early as mid-March.<br><br>During the first decade of the 21st century, I was beginning to think Ohio's climate was morphing into a Mediterranean-type situation. Summers during that period were hot and very dry, and the dryness extended into the autumn months. (After Katrina ravaged the New Orleans area in 2005, the storm tracked inland and provided us with a very welcome and much needed inch or so of rainfall.) We would receive most of our precipitation in winter and spring. One year--2008, I believe--we had a very dry autumn, and we experienced daytime temperatures in the 90s (F) in early October. I had never seen weather that hot that late in the season before. Rainfall, when it came, was usually of the torrential variety, with a lot of runoff.<br><br>Since about 2010, though, we have begun experiencing the oscillations John speaks of here. From the mildest winter I can remember in 2011-12 to one of the severest this past winter; from hot, dry summers to the current mild, wet one (my tomatoes aren't ripening either, LewisLucanBooks), we've experienced strange fluctuations in our weather patterns.<br><br><a href=#c684584756177306673 title="comment permalink">8/1/14, 5:13 AM</a><br><br>

Here in Canberra we had the warmest day in July for years (max 17 degrees C) yesterday, followed by what should be probably the coldest day of the year (max 8 degrees C) and a possible (near) snow forecast. Coupled with that back home (NZ) has been getting drier and drier over the last few years (it was usually at the rainfall level of your Pacific Northwest). Scientists have many way of dealing with chaotic systems, and in this case even one as complicated as the climate can be roughly analysed by smoothing out the noise and noticing the general trends.<br><br>I recently read NIWA (the NZ governmental climate agency's) report that El Nino is set to strike NZ/Australia this summer again. Your post today makes me wonder on how these climate cycles are interacting with the disturbances we are creating in the ecosystem. I don't even have a fraction of the brilliant climate knowledge of the other commenters here, but one can expect the interaction between the Pacific Northwest and Australasian climate systems to change once our inputs (the climates in both areas) changes.<br><br>Also, your emphasis on systems analysis is much appreciated by an engineering student such as I, especially one who studies at an institution that (tries) to structure the degree around such thinking.

When you're trying to wrap your head around systems behavior, just think: <i>It's all about energy flow.</i><br><br>Energy moves through systems. (If it doesn't, they would be just static structures, not systems at all.) When it moves through systems, the general behavior is governed by a) how hard energy is trying to pour through; and b) the structure of the system through which the energy has to find its way.<br><br>JMG: <i>Chris, okay, put your hand in the bathtub and don't move it at all. Your hand is CO2. Until your hand starts moving -- that is, until the CO2 concentration starts changing -- it doesn't begin to have more than a very slight effect on the system. The faster the hand moves -- that is, the faster CO2 concentration in the atmosphere changes -- the more disruption you get. If the hand then stops moving, the disruption dies down. Does that make a bit more sense?</i><br><br>Under the lens of energy flow, it seems (to me at least) to make all the sense in the world. In this explanation, the energy being pushed into the system is biomechanical energy from your muscles. Your hand, as JMG correctly notes, is analogous to CO2 being introduced into the planet's meteorological, ecological, and oceanic systems: it's the means for increased energy to be bucketing around in the system, first as smooth oscillations, then as more nonlinear craziness as the pent-up energy makes things shake.<br><br>The mental trick here is that, in Systems Theory, <i>change in energy input always changes the structure of the system</i>. It might not involve mechanical restructuring, at least not right away - patterns of heat distribution are another kind of structure, one that also influences system behavior. But as soon as a different energy flow starts entering the system, it has potential to change the game.<br><br>(continued)<br><br><a href=#c8893151729974376405 title="comment permalink">8/1/14, 6:52 AM</a><br><br>

A lot of the energy, on its long strange trip, gets "stranded": it enters parts of the system that it cannot quickly exit. Physicists call this energy that isn't entirely free to flow "potential energy". The distribution of potential energy in the system, just as much as the system's physical structure, determines the location and capacity of pathways for energy flow. Think of the level of "potential" as being how hard the energy is trying to escape its present location. <br><br>Every energy storage device is an example of a structure that strands energy until you want it.<br><br>Energy "leaves" the system, once and for all, when its potential is so low that nothing in the system can induce it to flow back into play. This general kind of energy loss is called "sinking": once it's gone down the drain you can't get it back. So, bear in mind that <i>energy wants to sink</i> (or, to use JMG's <a href=../../2010/02/energy-follows-its-bliss.html rel=nofollow>much more elegant formulation</a>, energy seeks its "bliss", and the bliss is to shed potential.)<br><br>So now we have a basic way to reason about the bathtub analogy.<br><br>Your hand in the water directly pushes mechanical energy <i>in</i>. CO2 in the atmosphere makes it harder for energy to <i>drain away</i>. Both of these will cause roughly the same kinds of swings and wiggles and crashes in observed system behavior, as excess energy is rattling the bars of its cage.<br><br>After a while, as the excess energy in the system drains out, the shaking and shivering and swinging will die down. This is the system's new equilibrium.<br><br>...If you're still reading this, you will probably have noticed that Systems behavior is what one might call a "massive mindfrack": as you start to look at all of the interdependent parts, and their receding-horizons complexity of interaction, cognitive despair is a real possibility. Systems Theory is not a ride for the faint-hearted; but it looks like we're going to have to use whatever brains and heart we have, if we're goign to make sense of the world we will be living in.<br><br>Oh goodness. This has gone rather long... My apologies. It might need to become a blog post.<br><br><a href=#c8756092145347166425 title="comment permalink">8/1/14, 6:54 AM</a><br><br>

I am now reading and greatly enjoying Gene Logsdon's new version of an old book he wrote in the 70's called Small Scale Grain Raising. <br>Readable, full of info and encouragement, I think it's an idea whose time has come! This is largely how Asia has fed itself on rice for centuries - small family plots. It seems there is some sort of mental block among us moderns that says growing grains is for big outfits and it is not necessarily so.<br><br>One challenge for me is to figure out how to do it without things like a rototiller. Which I am already doing in my vegetable garden, with moderate success. That is, it's a bit early to tell, but I am pursuing a no till method. I don't see a reason to become addicted to a rototiller when that's not how it's going to be and not how it once was, but Logsdon, although very much an author for the back to land movement and organic movement, nonetheless mentions using tillers and combines. Some of his audience are small scale farmers with considerable acreage. I'm interested in growing grains on a scale of perhaps a tenth or twentieth of an acre.<br>Barley, I believe is underrated in modern times.

Not that the walking is easy, assuming there is a sidewalk, and not some barrier or frogger across some absurd number of lanes—ask why are there no "car roll" buttons for the drivers to tap to perhaps get a green in a cycle or two?

This is supposed to help fight global warming. <br><br>Pouring thousands of cubic yards of concrete, cutting down forests and building "equity housing" "doing our fair share" and other sociological nostrums are used as excuses for perpetuating the same old development and natural resource extraction paradigm, but this time with federal tax credits handed to the developers, no property or school taxes owed and exemption from all zoning and environmental impact reports. Money changes hands and existing communities get the paradigm shaft. <br><br>Problem for them is that the local citizens are rebelling and have gotten organized. They will not allow the County to become crowded with chipboard hive apartment buildings occupied by, in many cases, people from outside who have no connection to the community, no history of raising children or of having worked or paid taxes here. <br><br>There is a pressing need for low and moderate income units. The obvious solution is enabling homeowners to create second units, mother in law units, or junior units in existing homes which would enable economic survival for the homeowner, live in caretakers for an aging population, low rent for the new occupant and the maximum use of already built housing instead of erecting massive tax payer subsidized apartments.

Then I got involved with some communal/cooperative endeavors and found myself romanticizing "rugged individualism." For one, all sense of efficiency and expediency are lost to the lowest common denominator. And the sort of bold experimentation and creativity individuals are capable of is right out! <br><br>On top of that, while they afford you some non-conformity to the status quo, these "near-utopian" situations tend to be internally "clique"-ish in the extreme, with very heavy pressure to conform to the group. You can see this in anthropological studies of similar tribal societies living off the commons... they can be exceedingly cruel to folks unable or unwilling to conform or bow to the rule of the group. <br><br>These days, I'm honestly afraid that as a reaction to the bad idea of extremist "Individualism" we'll get the equal and opposite bad idea of an extreme and oppressive "communitiarianism" or "Cooperativism" as I hear it being called. OR more likely, our country will continue to divide like oil and water into "individualist" and "communist" societies, with no sensible middle. <br><br>Anyway, for most beings, the experience of the basic fabric of life is "just like this." Look around right now, boring ole computer, air, hearing, itching, discomfort... that's about the same experience most people have no matter what kind of external situation they're in. We have a tendency to think that's a bad situation (it isn't!) no matter where we're at, so... the grass is always greener somewhere else. <br><br>Somewhere else has its trade-offs... that's all I'm saying.<br><br><a href=#c3339024624384187372 title="comment permalink">8/1/14, 12:06 PM</a><br><br>

It's amazing how much change that alone has created. Waves of yellow dock and thistle, a rash of slugs followed by an influx of birds and frogs, rabbits and field mice everywhere, hawks over head (freaking out my chickens), and more birds and bees than I've ever seen before in our garden. I've realized now that these changes come in waves, one causing the other, cause and effect in action. But you need to be able to concentrate on a piece of land for a good amount of time to really see that, and also let a good bit of it go wild. Mostly we're all afflicted by attention spans the size of teenage gnats that we can't see this rather lovely ebbing and flowing.

Some of that time was at anchor next to remote “traditional” villages which typified the communal life. Yes, it has its advantages, no money, sharing resources, relatively self-sufficient, slow pace: certainly romantic from outside especially to people used living in individualistic competitive Western societies. But, as Luckmortal points out, there are always down-sides to any way of organizing society (because human nature is basically the same and, sorry to say, doesn’t improve en-mass like you seem to hope it will). Its not all peace and love and bountiful harvests; there were all the usual petty human jealousies, lazy vs. energetic people, a hierarchical structure with the usual top/bottom dogs, times when it didn’t rain for months and the whole village was in danger of crop failure. Villagers used to complain to us about the lack of freedom they had due to religious prohibitions and the fear of being ostracized if they didn’t tow the line. There was the usual caste system as well; some pigs were “more equal” than others.<br>I suggest you actually join an existing commune, live there for more than a year and report back what its actually like.

On a cold winter day, you go up into your attic and put in an extra 12 inches of insulation. Does that cause your upper floor to get warmer and warmer indefinitely? Of course not. The temperature rises to a new equilibrium point, and then levels off. The same thing happens when you put new CO2 insulation into Earth's atmospheric attic, because extra CO2 doesn't add additional energy to the system -- it just slows down the rate at which energy flows back out into space by a certain factor. Remember that there was already CO2 in the atmosphere before the industrial age began -- that was one layer of insulation, if you will -- and the new CO2 just adds another layer. Does that make more sense? <br><br>Avalterra, fair enough. It wasn't at all clear to me that you recognized it as a short term and futile process! No doubt it will be tried -- for that matter, natural gas is being burnt in huge quantities right now to extract tar from Canadian tar sands, so that sort of thing is already part of business as usual. <br><br>Geoeconomics, now factor in what will happen to the climate if enough of those towers are built to matter, and all that water vapor that might otherwise fall as precipitation is sucked out of the air. It amazes me how many people just can't get it through their heads that there's no such thing as a free lunch...<br><br>Mortal, and of course that's also an issue. <br><br>Steve, it's coming.

I've talked in this blog about the sort of false binary that insists that there are two and only two options -- this is another of them; business as usual in a corrupt capitalist society vs. moving to a rural commune and living off the land. The corrupt capitalist society <i>wants you</i> to think that those are the only options, because it knows perfectly well that the rural-commune thing won't work, and once it fails, you'll come back to the corrupt capitalist society convinced that you don't have any other options. <br><br>The challenge, here as elsewhere, is to break out of the false binary and find other options. They're out there, and if you get past the assumptions of today's pop culture, you can find them. <br><br>Kyoto, exactly -- except that long before that point arrives, the infrastructure needed to support the society that supports the petroleum industry will have collapsed. The question, and I don't know anyone who has an answer, is just how high the energy cost of extracting energy has to go before that latter threshold comes within reach.<br><br>Adrian, thanks for the info!<br><br>Chris, exactly -- it's the speed of change, not the fact of change, that determines whether the transition will be smooth, oscillating, or chaotic. <br><br>Rapier, it's a real mix.

I recognized my ignorance and so refused to state that I knew it wasn't real, but many others did not fall into this camp. I have heard, and do still frequently hear (as a conservative surrounded by conservatives) that the world has its own cycles, that volcanoes put out more CO2 than the US and we're all fine, and on and on. None of this rung true to me; these are all smart people who understand that complex systems exist. I knew they were repeating mantras. <br><br>I educated myself on it somewhat and after a great deal of sifting through political bias, concluded that it is happening and we are doing it. That's what the evidence says, period. In terms of how severe it will become, I've always thought that peak oil (an important part of a whole-systems approach to it) would likely prevent the worst fears from being realized. This is not to say it isn't a concern, of course, but that those who cry extinction are overreacting, as well as unduly loud.<br><br>But as to why many (not all) of my fellow conservatives often fail to recognize the truth, I think it can be explained by a very simple intellectual error that plagues almost everyone I know. The error is "this idea/theory/event serves a political interest, and therefore is false." It's really just that simple.<br><br>This explains why some people deny the Holocaust (it serves the political agenda of making the Jews evoke our sympathies, which doesn't jive with their hatred of Jews), the moon landing (it serves American exceptionalism or scientism, which they reject), terrorists being behind 9/11 (it serves the agenda of the imperialist neo-cons, whom the truthers despise), and climate change. There are a whole host of others as well.<br><br>Conservatives - or at least real paleo-conservatives, whose instincts at least remain among many Republicans - are deeply skeptical of big, centralized government action. They fear planned economies, over-regulation, authoritarianism, and extension of government interference into our lives. And if ever there were a narrative that supported all that, it's climate change.<br><br>Think of it. It's a problem that can only be fixed by enforced, worldwide coordinated activity - the epitome of centralization. Every action you take in modern life requires energy. Every bit of food you eat, job you work, entertainment you employ, tools you use - you name it, it requires energy, and therefore is a potential contributor to the problem. Which means it must be regulated, controlled, planned and meddled with. From this perspective, it's a totalitarian's dream come true. (Of course, the terrorism narrative is already serving that end quite well, but they dismiss that because they defended Bush for eight years out of blind party loyalty.)<br><br>If climate change is real, from this view, then big government may well be the answer. Yet we know that more government is always bad; therefore climate change is false. Give them a way to think climate change requires decentralization and free markets, and after a cooling-off period, they'll be fine with it.<br><br>Just my two cents. True paleo-conservatives are a rare breed today, and ones that also recognize climate change are rarer. It might be just me in fact. :) Anyway, I hope that helps at least a few people understand the resistance to it from the right.<br><br>I'm very much looking forward to the rest of the series, by the way. Keep up the good work.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c301428384546137862 title="comment permalink">8/2/14, 12:26 AM</a><br><br>

For instance, in a couple of replies you wrote:-<br><br>- "Avalterra, the reason you can afford 1/11 EROEI on a battery is that abundant energy from other sources is available to you. Government subsidies work for the same reason. If the energy isn't there, you're out of luck, for the same reason it doesn't help you to decide to eat three square meals a day if you're stranded on a desert island with no food at all." and<br><br>- "Avalterra, fair enough. It wasn't at all clear to me that you recognized it as a short term and futile process! No doubt it will be tried -- for that matter, natural gas is being burnt in huge quantities right now to extract tar from Canadian tar sands, so that sort of thing is already part of business as usual."<br><br>What it looks as though you're missing, that Avalterra actually brought out, is that although it's no long term fix it stays engineeringly practical for longer than just going for hydrocarbon resources directly: "abundant energy from other sources is available to you". That practicality is because of two things: the point Dmitry Orlov made, that what counts isn't how much energy you have to put in in relation to what you finally get but the relation to what you first get; and the fact that peak oil leads to absolute declines quite quickly, but worldwide peak coal is probably over a century away and peak natural gas somewhere in between, so you don't have to use the same <i>kind</i> of energy in as you get out (which means that it can still make sense even if it takes more energy in than you get out, provided you have a special need for the output and the input is cheap and available enough). So what you sound as if you're missing is that these tricks would genuinely buy time, as far as hydrocarbon availability goes and if you only consider engineering constraints. It sounds as though you think the tricks are all much of a muchness. True, ever fewer people would be able to afford the hydrocarbons, and true, the tricks don't actually solve anything as opposed to putting things off, and true, ecological, economic, political and other collapse issues generally would stop the tricks in their tracks, very possibly before the underlying resource constraints did - but the tricks aren't as close to their <i>physical</i> limitations as peak oil proper is.<br><br>To give a concrete example, right now Australia (where I am) could get all the ersatz oil it needs by altering its brown coal electric power generation to run off the semi-coke produced by the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karrick_process rel=nofollow>Karrick process</a> using that same brown coal, getting the ersatz oil produced cross-subsidised by the electric power generation; that doesn't even need the same level of plant as full blown synthetic oil, though the yield is lower and prohibitively costly without enough of an offsetting use for the semi-coke. The limits to that are how long the coal lasts and how long the infrastructure doesn't collapse, so it too is no fix - but that isn't as close a barrier as how long oil proper can be drilled offshore or imported.<br><br>Separately, you wrote "Onething, you can get adequate calories off potatoes and other starchy tuber crops". I once looked into options for small households and came up with a short list that also had carrots, with guinea pigs for protein. I can rake the list up if people want to see it.<br><br><a href=#c8508220623552659351 title="comment permalink">8/2/14, 2:02 AM</a><br><br>

I have to say my preferred term these days is climate chaos rather than any of the alternatives, as it captures the extreme &amp; chaotic nature of the variations we are seeing. Whereas global weirding won't automatically make people think about the climate, climate change doesn't necessarily sound dangerous and global warming is subject to the problem that oscillations in the colder than average direction immediately leads to the deniers taking it as evidence the planet isn't warming, even though the underlying trend definitely is. You even get idiots such as the ex Minister of the Environment in the UK who thought global warming would be a good thing as we can grow more crops, he never even bothered to meet with scientific advisors who would have told him that the IPCC analysis shows significant detrimental effects on global crop yields as the climate gets hotter.<br><br>Here in the UK we've definitely been getting significant oscillations in climate which are becoming increasingly extreme. Over the last few years we have had several periods of intense rainfall, in the case of last winter as part of a series of unusually severe winter storms, which has lead to widespread flooding. Poor land and watercourse management practices contributed to this, exacerbated by Government cuts to the departments such as the Environment Agency which are responsible for flood prevention and by perverse agricultural subsidies which require farmers to remove vegetation other than grass or arable crops from their land.<br><br>We have also had periods of unusually dry, unusually cold and unusually warm weather over the last few years, which appears to be at least partially the result of meanders in the jet stream causing blocking patterns. On a practical level this leads to significant differences from year to year which affect the success of plant &amp; animal species. As gardeners &amp; foragers we are getting a lot of variation from year to year in what plants do well and what don't do so well. It's hard to predict what is going to happen next with weather patterns so the best strategy is to grow as wide a variety of stuff as we can. Last year was an excellent year for tree fruit. This year we have huge onions but have had to lift the potatoes a bit early as they were showing signs of blight.<br><br>So awareness of and preparedness for oscillations in climate as well as an overall warming trend is going to become increasingly important.<br><br>BTW my understanding of the physics of the atmosphere is that overall higher concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases such as methane (which needs to be factored in to any model as the effects could be significant at least in the medium term) is that this will cause more heat to be trapped, leading to higher water evaporation and more rainfall and more big storms in some parts of the world, as well as increases in sea-levels due to melting glaciers &amp; ice-sheets. So we will have more extreme weather even when CO2 is no longer increasing and there may well be unexpected effects that are not predicted by current models as our understanding of the complex interactions involved is necessarily incomplete.<br><br><a href=#c7233143951597845467 title="comment permalink">8/2/14, 2:22 AM</a><br><br>

In my experience of the social circles I move in here in the UK (druids/pagans &amp; green activists) that most of the people I know are making changes in their own lives, to adapt to peak oil, climate change &amp; economic decline. And many other people who are not involved in these kinds of circles are also making some changes in their lives in response to increases in fuel prices &amp; decreases in real incomes.<br><br>In my own life I and my husband have been making gradual changes to our lifestyles over the past decade to reduce our reliance on the fossil-fuel based economy including:<br><br>- Slashing our gas &amp; electric bills to way below the average by insulating our loft, getting double-glazing, draft-proofing, getting a wood-burning stove to replace our electric fire, getting solar PV on the roof, getting high efficiency boiler &amp; other household appliances and reducing electricity use through using low-energy bulbs, stand-by busters etc. We also want to get external wall insulation but have struggled with finding someone to install it and with getting planning permission.<br><br>- Producing much of our own fuel for heating through using waste wood left at the allotments down our road and by buying a few acres of woodland which we can harvest sustainably for woodfuel.<br><br>- Producing a lot of our own fruit &amp; vegetables through growing stuff on our allotment &amp; foraging in the woods. We are not self-sufficient in this and also have to buy in grain products, protein, dairy, fats &amp; sugar-based products but we are gradually extending the range of what we grow and make ourselves and can buy or trade for some things such as eggs from colleagues who keep chickens who get more eggs than they know what to do with.<br><br>- We have experienced a reduction in our income partially voluntarily &amp; partially involuntarily, but so far we have managed to reduce our costs in line with the reduction in our incomes. We don't buy much 'stuff' and when we do it is more likely to be from a charity shop or local independent trader as from a big company. We also don't go out much to paid entertainments, these are an occasional special treat, the rest of the time we are perfectly happy spending time at home, in the woods or with friends.<br><br>- The area we have done least to address as yet is personal transport. We both drive as we both need to for work purposes - me as a community health worker covering a large urban &amp; rural patch, my husband as an environmental education performer at events such as wood fairs. We have downsized our cars to more fuel efficient and lower emissions cars and use them less for non-essential journeys, partially due to the increasing cost of fuel. At present the benefits of keeping our cars outweigh the costs. I don't know if this will continue to be the case for the rest of our potential active lives (I'm late 40's, husband is mid 50's in age), but we will have to adapt as needed in the future.<br><br>I think the most realistic approach is to make gradual lifestyle changes rather than trying to go cold turkey on everything that is dependent on the fossil-fuel economy. There's no point getting too far ahead of the curve of decline. I think adaptation to the long decline will be bottom up rather than top down. But those who refuse to adapt in a realistic &amp; constructive manner will probably make things pretty messy &amp; unpleasant for the rest of us as well as themselves. All we can do is keep our heads down and do our best in our own lives &amp; our own communities.<br><br><a href=#c8420464879624373756 title="comment permalink">8/2/14, 3:04 AM</a><br><br>

Weird extremes are noticeable locally and make the National News as well as upending lives and expectations. Impacts will be the name of the game this next 100 years or so. We can experience the range of human reactions, but with luck, the responses can rally sympathy and on balance engender impulses to help others, and not just focus on ’getting away with it’. <br><br>I think it is possible to gain from personal insight by reflecting / meditating on the biosphere and the rolling globe. One can include vision through the eyes of instruments and go down through the layers of the amazing geological records. Not quite as dodgy as taking untested hallucinogens and I guess one can even do it while in the bath tub! <br><br>Using my PC I attempted a version of this (not in the tub!) after a challenge from Ugo Bardi. My reading of up-to-date studies (2012) on methane and the carbon cycle past and present and my own “ah…ha” moments led me to believe that the large increase in atmospheric methane in industrial decades was not [emphasis] likely the presage of a Methane Apocalypse anytime soon – though poking the Carbon Cycle with sticks still seems a very bad and dangerous game for pretentious bipeds. The overall situation nevertheless remains very striking. I labelled my contribution a “Personal Quest”. http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/methane-and-disturbed-carbon-cycle.html <br><br>Just a technical point: CO2, at present the key forcing agent that alters the global energy equilibrium, that is the balance of incoming heat and outgoing loss, is already at huge levels unprecedented in the Holocene – our present interglacial – and the present concentration is going to go higher. We are way off equilibrium already and this is going to get worse. In geological terms this is a very brief pulse, but it happens to be a very big one. I endorse your view though, that carbon emissions will peak well before mid-century. I recently did my own back-of-envelope calculation based on estimates of future ‘economically’ extracted / mined fossil fuel (data from Aleklett for NG and coal, and Laherrere for oil). After ‘peak emissions’, the actual CO2 level in the atmosphere will nevertheless continue to rise until the annual rate of removal by the biosphere / ocean matches the amount still being emitted annually. When the rates match we should see Peak Atmospheric CO2. This peak could happen around the turn of the Century at around double pre-industrial values circa 570ppm. (I calculated this using some ratios I obtained here: Gillett, 2011; http://sos.noaa.gov/Docs/ngeo1047-aop.pdf )<br> <br>‘Our’ pulse of CO2 will then decline during following centuries. The brevity of the pulse means that a new global temperature balance (equilibrium) is unlikely to reach the full global 3 deg C rise that would otherwise likely follow from a longer period at doubled CO2, but it will be very substantial and raised temperature will continue over many centuries. Even less welcome is that the extraordinary rapidity of the pulse of Green House Gases might have its own extreme effects. We will need to do more than just brace ourselves and hold on to hats!<br><br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><a href=#c2811573448100972955 title="comment permalink">8/2/14, 5:05 AM</a><br><br>

Five million barrels a day is the goal. The need for natural gas and diesel used to extract those five million barrels reduces the net energy significantly. But then again, we all know about the shale gas energy renaissance ;-P<br>… Of course some say there just isn’t enough water for the process, so that may pre-empt the effort before net energy becomes an issue. <br>The propaganda says otherwise of course. The current government has an official “Action Plan” for job creation, which is the name given to a major shift in activity from the traditional eastern-based industries to the Alberta-centred bitumen operations where the jobless are flocking to make a decent salary, only to pay exorbitant rents and other indecent costs of living typical of boom times. Etc. etc…<br>This plan for the economy seems to be the unspoken consensus, even if there is a fair bit of vocal, active opposition to things like exploding freight trains and risky pipelines through the wilderness, my guess is that enough people (and key people) will pursue the illusion of tar sands development to its sorry conclusion.

It was very helpful to me for visualizing the basic trajectory of climate change - an increasing tendency towards turbulence.<br><br>Reading this post gave me two major thoughts:<br><br>1) As hinted at by your first post in the Dark Ages America series the crisis of our age is one of stacked predicaments that feed into each other dynamically. Let's take three rather obvious examples of predicament of entirely mechanistic origin: <br><br>1) Climate change leads to glacial melt leading to coastal flooding, desertification and extreme weather.<br><br>2) Climate change leads to increase vectors for disease.<br><br>3) Energy depletion leads infrastructure that cannot be maintained.<br><br>Now comes the fun part! If we combine these predicaments together we get NEW predicaments:<br><br>1 &amp; 2 together lead to mass migrations of people carrying disease and epidemics of disease in shanty towns.<br><br>1 &amp; 3 together leads to highly accelerated infrastructure destruction leading to likely transportation failures and famine in geographically isolated areas.<br><br>2 &amp; 3 together leads to multiple waves of epidemic occurring without effective intervention from the medical system.<br><br>I only choose several variables to explore for the sake of space and simplicity but there are more of course; if I had included climate change and crop failure as one, I would have had to include warfare when combined with the dislocations of coastal flooding etc.<br><br>When I see how much the various predicaments interact with one another it makes me wonder if we will be able to preserve things like literacy since the amount of social disruption beggars my imagination.<br><br>The second thing that your post made me reflect on is with climate change, as well as the other interacting predicaments, is that there hardly seems to be ANY safe choice. There is no one thing anyone can do and expect safety of any sort. The turbulence of the systems involved make predicting any specific outcomes for specific places and people for specific times effectively impossible.<br><br>These predicament threaten every aspect of our biological desires and appetites. They threaten our ability to find food, have shelter, raise children to adulthood and even threaten our raw survival.<br><br>Mainstream culture seems to me to revolve around safety and convenience. Safety, each passing year, will fail more and more people who will be submerged in an increasingly dangerous world. Finding worldviews and meanings that can make sense of danger and risk are thereby absolutely essential for anyone wishing to survive as danger and risk, rather than safety and convenience, are central to our emerging reality.<br><br><a href=#c612360832287479983 title="comment permalink">8/2/14, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

Subtropical magnolias and sweet-gums blend with boreal pines and aspens, anchored by a rich array of temperate oaks, maples, ashes, hickories, walnuts, elms, beeches, lindens, birches, and many others. <br><br>It's a terrible thought that the creeks and sandstone arches of the Cumberland Plateau might one day be stripped bare of all that magnificence.<br><br><a href=#c1989228985015183910 title="comment permalink">8/2/14, 9:44 AM</a><br><br>

The irony is, of course, that anthropogenic climate change can't be fixed by enforced, worldwide, coordinated activity -- all attempts to do it that way have foundered on the unwillingness of the political class to accept the limitations on their own lifestyles that fixing climate change would require. A conservative analysis of climate change, it seems to me, would point out the futility of such top-down solutions, and focus on the perverse incentives put in place by governments that privilege fossil fuel use and guarantee that those who benefit most from fossil fuel extraction and burning don't have to pay the costs of their actions. <br><br>P.M. Lawrence, of course you can bring in other energy sources, but once you do so you're constrained by the net energy of those sources -- and that constraint is far more significant than arguments of Avalterra's sort tend to recognize. One real-world example is the attempt by Germany in 1943-1945 to use coal-to-liquids technology to replace petroleum for the Wehrmacht. Despite the best technology on the planet and an effectively limitless supply of disposable slave labor, that effort failed, because the EROEI of coal plus the conversion process was so low. (South Africa could only manage a variant of the same thing with SASOL by subsidizing its economy with gold and diamonds.) <br><br>Yes, it's technically feasible to run your electrical grid off brown coal via the Karrick process, but <a href=../../2014/03/the-crocodiles-of-reality.html rel=nofollow>technical feasibility is not the same thing as economic viability</a>; have you crunched the numbers to see whether such a process would pay for itself at a cost for electricity that the Australian economy can support? That's the question that matters -- in this case, and a great many more. <br><br>Anne, I'm pleased to see some environmental activists walking their talk. It's just that there seem to be so few of them. <br><br>Phil, that seems about right. I'll be talking about methane next week, for what that's worth. <br><br>Steve, the lake's doing its best to absorb some of the extra CO2 -- though I don't imagine that's any consolation just now. <br><br>Bruno, thanks for the data! <br><br>Kyoto, your post went through fine.

Yes, it's the convergence of multiple crises that makes our predicament the mess that it is. I'd offer an emendation to your comment about safe choices: there are none. It's that simple. The population of the planet is going to decline by a very large factor over the next couple of centuries, and that means that for the great majority of people, every choice they have will lead to failure and death.

Very important is the north-south trend of the ranges, which keeps biota from being stranded during warming and cooling, permitting northward and southward migrations. Also, as anyone who has hiked off-trail in Appalachia will attest, the mountains are not high compared to the western ranges, but they are steep. You don't have a to cover a lot of horizontal distance to climb 1000m in elevation, which cools you off by about 5-8C, allowing you to quickly adjust to climate swings. Those two attributes still exist, and combined with orographic-effect precipitation from the west, east, and south, they've let the biota survive and diversify through the Pleistocene climate swings. A third one, though, is gone -- Passenger Pigeons. Abundant long-distance migrants that carried large heavy seeds north or south by hundreds of kilometers in a single day. There is nothing like them left, and all the forest trees that co-evolved with them and have very large, heavy seeds are out of luck now. Their surviving closest relatives, Mourning Doves, are substantially smaller, don't feed on the large intact seeds, and are much less migratory. The role of the Passenger Pigeon will probably be loosely approximated by humans in the future, but we are not going to move the same species around in the same ways as the birds did. <br><br>Chris -- only 25 tree species? We've got over 40 of them just on our little 39 acres in middle TN, 30 of which grow to overstory canopy height. And we only span 70m in elevation on these acres (and yes, that 70m elevation change happens in about 70m horizontally!)<br><br><a href=#c5319421218801790074 title="comment permalink">8/2/14, 9:13 PM</a><br><br>

However, after visiting them and speaking with the people living there and the sorts of issues they encountered, my internal alarm bells were all going off - loudly. I decided then and there that it was a very bad idea.<br><br>It isn't really possible to be 100% self-sufficient on a property anyway. <br><br>Just for one example: you may grow all of your own food that you consume. You may even have surplus with which to trade. You may even have skills with which to brew your own sacred brews for distribution or be able to provide basic medical care. Yet, you may not be able to produce linen for use in clothing for just a single example. Maybe the area that you live in has a mineral deficiency too?<br><br>The simple answer is that you require a village. Yet that entails limitations that most people these days would find to be abhorrent.<br><br>How would you feel having someone else dictate who you married? What if an outside authority told you how many or even if you could have children - and enforced it (often brutally)? What if you were never to travel more than 10 miles from your home? What if the entire village knew the history of your life and family - every single detail - and never allowed for any personal growth or any escape from a stupid youthful escapade? What if they judged you based on that history rightly or wrongly? What if they denied you an education - even if you displayed a propensity to learn?<br><br>I could keep on going. Few people in Industrial countries concern themselves with the very real freedoms that they currently enjoy. It is a sort of sad state of affairs from my perspective.<br><br>I rarely offer advice, but in this particular case I feel that you are without a rudder. My suggestion is this: As you are currently devoid of employment, I suggest to you to learn how to brew alcohol from all manner of things. Yes, I am serious too. Brewing was traditionally a female occupation and it provides you with a source of community power and also protection from harm that you may never have previously understood and may or may not need in the future.<br><br>Anyway, that's what my crystal ball told me about you!<br><br>Keep your chin up!<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c99950437829355495 title="comment permalink">8/3/14, 3:09 AM</a><br><br>

She's in her early thirties, in the process of a divorce, two young sons, works in the accounts department of a local company. I came away with a 3kg tub of deliciously tart blackcurrant jam that she made yesterday. I balked at taking so much, but she showed me a stack of similar tubs. She has plenty to spare, and she'll be getting more berries soon, along with cucumbers, garlic, rose-hips, and more, all of which she'll be preserving in one way or another. All of this comes from her father's garden, and I doubt he's given her everything. Very many of my students, who mostly live in Piter itself, have dachas and are spending their weekends there, or even living there full-time, during this unusually hot and humid summer.<br><br>On the train coming back in to town, I sat opposite two women. One was a fine-looking woman whose age I hesitate to guess - anything from forties to early sixties. The other was younger, maybe early twenties. Both were dressed in smocks, headscarves, and long skirts and, frankly, wouldn't have looked out of place in any photo of Russia for the last hundred years or more. I could honestly have imagined them protesting against the Tsar as easily as I could see them digging tank traps to stop the Panzers. They got off in Kupchino, the southernmost suburb of St. Petersburg, which has a reputation for being a tough area. I suspect it's a more complex place than that, and wouldn't be surprised to hear of gypsies and peasants keeping ponies in their tower-block apartments, as is said to happen in parts of Dublin…<br><br>My point? None, really. I suppose it's just evidence that a) Russia is well-prepared for a slow collapse, just as many have already pointed out, and b) it's an image for me to remember as I wonder how a near-future West might look.<br><br>On a related topic, @Robert Mathiesen wrote: "Putin is, in my own judgement, far and away the most intelligent and rational head-of-state Russia has had since the 1700s". ABsolutely right. The KGB was a very, very effective organization - and a very proud one, too. It wasn't all, or even mostly, about the gulags and domestic spying; it was a uniformed, military structure. Putin is clever, dedicated to the protection of his homeland, and well aware of what it is to be at the sharp end of that task.<br><br><a href=#c522044373407571920 title="comment permalink">8/3/14, 5:59 AM</a><br><br>

As things get worse… well, the "run to Wales" meme goes as far back as John Wyndham's <i>The Kraken Wakes</i> and perhaps further, as if there weren't already people living there.

But they're not <i>as</i> constrained as peak oil by itself, and they <i>would</i> push the technical, engineering crunch back materially. So Avalterra's sort do get the point after all, and you are just talking past each other.<br><br>"One real-world example is the attempt by Germany in 1943-1945 to use coal-to-liquids technology to replace petroleum for the Wehrmacht. Despite the best technology on the planet and an effectively limitless supply of disposable slave labor, that effort failed, because the EROEI of coal plus the conversion process was so low."<br><br>Well, <i>no</i>. That attempt actually <i>succeeded</i>, in technical terms. It only didn't deliver because of the <i>other</i> collapse issues; we will face different ones than Germany did then, but Germany fell short because of the attrition caused by bombing that affected transport infrastructure and the synthesis plants. It did <i>not</i> fail from EROEI issues, because those do <i>not</i> apply here. EROEI would only have applied if the oil output had been needed to drive the conversion of coal to oil; actually, that was driven by even more coal.<br><br>"(South Africa could only manage a variant of the same thing with SASOL by subsidizing its economy with gold and diamonds.)"<br><br>Well, no. That coal to oil thing, SASOL, was all about autarky. Gold and diamonds were only relevant for foreign exchange, to get things from abroad - but those were precisely what weren't going into SASOL, because South Africa was after being able to go it alone. What it took to mobilise its own resources were its own internal taxes, armed force and bureaucracy, to access its own coal and labour. The process itself needed plant to apply the technology, but they had the latter and got the former in the same internal way.<br><br><a href=#c2367398229071783393 title="comment permalink">8/3/14, 6:37 AM</a><br><br>

That's the question that matters -- in this case, and a great many more."<br><br>You're not taking into account the very caveats Avalterra and I made, like my "True, ever fewer people would be able to afford the hydrocarbons, and true, the tricks don't actually solve anything as opposed to putting things off, and true, ecological, economic, political and other collapse issues generally would stop the tricks in their tracks, very possibly before the underlying resource constraints did - but the tricks aren't as close to their <i>physical</i> limitations as peak oil proper is". That turns the rest of what we put into an exaggerated form that doesn't hold up.<br><br>So, yes, I know perfectly well that "technical feasibility is not the same thing as economic viability"; that was the whole point to my telling you that very thing. I fully acknowledged that other stuff could well bring it all to a halt, I was only trying to show you, what you haven't taken on board, that coal to oil conversion's technical feasibility wouldn't hit its own inherent flaws as soon as peak oil by itself would. That throws the ball back into the court of the wider collapse factors, which I fully acknowledge form the constraint.<br><br>And, yes, I have looked into "whether such a process would pay for itself at a cost for electricity that the Australian economy can support". The thing is, it does <i>not</i> materially affect that; brown coal is being burned now in power stations anyway, and the simple <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karrick_process rel=nofollow>Karrick process</a> I mentioned isn't taking much additional energy as it is almost only extracting hydrocarbons with minimal further conversion (unlike full blown, SASOL style stuff). The numbers don't work out if you just apply that process to get ersatz oil and end up with vast amounts of semi-coke you can't use as a copious by-product (but only because the SASOL approach starts making more sense - and even that can use built up stocks of semi-coke, so it needn't be implemented so fast that there is a bottleneck). However, if you keep running the power stations on the semi-coke, all that cost is covered because the ersatz oil is the by-product, right up until you need more ersatz oil than is being produced on the cheap that way. It's like the way free range chickens were cheap extras on farms for as long as they were few enough that they could forage on the waste like dropped grain, but their costs went up as soon as there were so many that you needed to feed them deliberately. But, since Australia has ample supplies of brown coal and nothing better to do with it than burn it near the mines (unlike the higher quality coal Australia exports, which can be transported more practically), the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karrick_process rel=nofollow>Karrick process</a> would continue to make enough economic sense even after hitting that point where electricity production ceases to cover the bulk of the costs - because it wouldn't cost more <i>money</i> so much as more <i>brown coal input</i> (though the SASOL approach would then make even more sense). How can I be so sure of all this? Because precisely that was done with a variant of that process to get shale oil when autarky was thrust on Australia during the Second World War, with no covering electricity production at all, and what with sunk costs it was kept going into the 1950s.<br><br><a href=#c4539228105547484659 title="comment permalink">8/3/14, 6:39 AM</a><br><br>

Nicholas probably thinks he is reading continental philosophy if he is tackling Nietzsche and Heidegger, but his use of the word "woo" and distaste for the word "Destiny", even when it is non-theological as in Spengler, clearly indicates that he is stuck in an analytic perspective.

(For those who don't know, 2-3 years ago, the USDA released all new climate zones for the entire U.S. Basically, EVERY area in the U.S. become warmer by at least one growing zone. The Arbor Day foundation has a great animated clip showing how the zones moved.) I knew then that we were going over the waterfall with climate change, especially because the USDA went to great lengths to clarify that just because the U.S. was getting warmer in every area of the country DID NOT MEAN that global warming was happening.

You'll do fine in life...just keep plugging. Re: sustainability. Native Americans were completely sustainable, but their ancestors spent thousands of years carefully managing their large territories to naturally produce abundant quantities of food (they just didn't fence or plow the land, so the Europeans thought it was 'wilderness' and disregarded all of the work that had gone into it). I've read quite a lot about how natives managed the land, and what I can tell you is that it will take at least 200 years (if we start now) of extensive repair work before any of this country will naturally support any size of population (meaning: support a fraction of what was the original Native population, not the current U.S. population). We've destroyed all the natural systems that supported large numbers of game and fish and plowed under and paved over the endless fields of roots, tubers, nut trees, and native grains that once abided everywhere. Point being: you can't get from A (current industrial system) to Z (group sustainability off the land) without having an intermediate game plan, such as JMG discusses.

So, just want to give my two cents worth.<br><br>Regarding statements and points of view held by Californians towards folks from other states, I’ve not really heard many negative statements about people based on where they live. Usually, I’ve heard more along the liberal/conservative, red state/blue state type stuff, or gods help us the racial and ethnic baloney. But, I don’t believe that as a rule southern Californians think Oklahomans are a lesser species fit only for menial labor. This is one of the more bizarre and specific mindsets I’ve read attributed to Californians. Maybe a few people think that way? But, certainly not even a significant or measurable minority.<br><br>Sure, we have our share of rude and arrogant knuckleheads, but knuckleheads don’t all originate in California. Don’t we all usually notice rude and arrogant people no matter where they’re from? I’ve met more than my share of rude and arrogant Californians, but I’ve also met plenty of polite and modest Californians, too. And, I’ve met plenty of rude and arrogant people who hail from many other parts of the world. My stepfather-in-law, for example, is one of the more arrogant, ignorant, and infantile people I’ve ever met and he’s from England. But, I certainly do not consider that he is a fair representative of his country. And, we’ve all heard about the archetypal Ugly American. I expect that there are some broad patterns, though, I have found it best not to generalize or consider very small sample sizes as representative.

And I misspoke; the Mourning Dove was the Passenger Pigeon's closest *sympatric* relative; it's closest relative overall is the allopatric Band-tailed Pigeon of the western mountains. But Bandtails don't form the enormous flocks, nor are they such long-distance migrants. Occasional strays do show up in the east (I found South Carolina's first record myself, in fact, way back in 1991), so they do have the potential to colonize the east especially if megadrought pushes them out of the west. My guess though is that it was the long-term cycle of megadroughts that made the two species differentiate in the first place; leaving their ancestors isolated from each other on opposite sides of the Great Desert over and over again through the glacial cycles. <br><br>I expect that the large-seed-munching niche (currently filled very inefficiently by squirrels, as evidenced by the huge piles of uneaten acorns, hickorynuts, and walnuts that litter the ground around our house every autumn) is more likely to be filled by some exotic species imported or invading from somewhere else, rather than by evolution. We also used to have an abundant parrot in this area, of course, and many of the soft-fruited trees coevolved with the Carolina Parakeet just as the nut-bearers did with the pigeons. The piles of rotting fruit under the wild plums in late autumn are a sad testament to the loss of this species as well -- it was its fondness for fruit that lead to its being shot into oblivion as a "pest." There are plenty of other parrots in the world that could easily take over where the Carolina left off. <br><br>Of course, if advanced technology survives long enough, there are serious talks about resurrecting these extinct "keystone" birds from the DNA in museum specimens. It is very close to feasible right now. I am not sure whether I find this freaky, or a suitable (and bare minimal) atonement and reparation for at least one or two of the many horrific sins that our technological era has committed against the biosphere. I am always wary of technological solutions to the problems created by technology...<br><br><a href=#c6343710479844690807 title="comment permalink">8/4/14, 6:51 AM</a><br><br>

It's going to be a complicated, messy process driven by competing economic and political interests, population pressures, social and cultural beliefs, and so on.<br><br>Now, I'm not sure I have a full and complete understanding of the EROEI issues being discussed here by JMG, Avalterra, and P.M. Lawrence. However, it seems to me that if you have a certain amount of coal and you want to use that coal for a coal-to-liquids scheme or to burn it to extract oil from the ground that has an EROEI lower than the coal or even in the negative territory, then you're engaging in an unnecessary loss of energy. You're using the coal to create a liquid that provides you less energy than if you just burned the coal.<br><br>Can that happen? Sure, yes, if it's technically feasible. But if you do that in an energy-constrained world (which is what we're talking about here, after all) then you're subtracting net energy from the system. In the energy-constrained world of the near future, there's going to be strong demand for all available energy. There's going to be competition over it. And, therefore, subtracting net energy is going to be a contentious issue.<br><br>Of course there will be parties who would prefer to turn a certain amount of coal into a certain less amount (energy wise) of burnable liquids, because they have more use for liquids than for coal. But there <em>also</em> are going to be parties that will happily burn that coal and gain the full use of energy from it. Therefore, there's going to be competition over that coal: one side wanting the direct burning of the coal and its full energy content and another side wanting a lower-net-energy liquid derived from that coal.<br><br>This is where all the various economic, political, societal, and cultural pressures come in. How that shakes out is impossible to say and entirely dependent on the details and variables. But, in an energy-constrained world, I suspect I would have better luck betting on outcomes that led to greater net energy. More often than not, I suspect that would be the outcome.<br><br>But the point here is that the process will not be centrally controlled. Saying that liquid fuel is more useful than coal is only true within certain contexts. And in an energy-constrained world, it's going to <em>always</em> be true only for certain people and not true for others. Some will have greater use of the liquids, others will have greater use of the higher net energy. So the decision of how to use that coal becomes economic, political, and so on. Technical feasibility is only the first step. If it is technically feasible, then it's an option, but then economics, politics, culture, etc. gets to fight over the final decision of how to utilize that coal.<br><br>And again, if I'm a betting man in that scenario, I'm placing my bets on the higher net energy. I'll lose some of those bets, but I probably win a heck of a lot more.<br><br>It has to be remembered that we're entering a period that's going to be characterized by greater and greater chaos, due to the failure of the underlying systems that provide our current stability and understanding of the world. Therefore, trying to make predictions about the future that work within the current assumptions of rationality are, as often as not, likely to fail. Today's rational decision is not necessarily tomorrow's rational decision, because the context likely will be dramatically different.<br><br><a href=#c7502022107500510661 title="comment permalink">8/4/14, 10:53 AM</a><br><br>

Ever...<br><br>One advantage we will have in the next two or three decades is a massive surplus of labour, which will be very helpful for civil engineering projects. From what I understand you only need to alter about 80-100 sq miles of land to create a micro-climate.

At its height in the 60’s it had a large scale Agri base, car repair business, etc. It was very “socialistic” at first. Upon joining, you had to give up all your personal assets, and in return got a house to live in, free meals in the communal hall, a small amount of spending money, use of a car. It went into decline in the 70’s when most of the kids of the founders moved away. Still going today, but not on the same basis and not a functioning semi-self-sufficient economic unit now.

Although Members didn’t have to give up their personal assets, they must put in 10 hrs/week on various communal tasks like gardening or maintaining the communal infrastructure. There is no religious underpinning, but all the founders (many of whom were not native born New Zealanders) had a vision of actually living an “alternative” to the existing individualistic Capitalist society. At the beginning, pretty much all the members were poor youngish folks with a bit of capital and lots of energy, and most worked inside the commune. Over the years, some got rich by working on the “outside,” some remained poor, some new members came in with money, so now there is the usual stratification of money “inside” the commune, and some of the richer members even pay the less rich to do their communal manual labor! Again, the organism evolves. <br>On the “outside,“ most people work jobs for cash and pay the government via taxes to take care of the communal stuff like sewage, water, etc. They also avoid dealing with the internal politics of the organizations they pay to do the work for them. <br>In the commune, the members had to deal with all that, work and politics day-to-day, and learn to live with each other not just as casual “neighbors down the block.”<br>My guess is that in the de-industrialized, more localized, future, various forms of more or less communal living will evolve to meet the needs of those who survive.<br><br><br><a href=#c7549696855577863839 title="comment permalink">8/4/14, 8:46 PM</a><br><br>

If you can show me solid reasons to think we'll get climate shifts more drastic than the super-greenhouse events of the Toarcian and the Cenomanian-Turonian epochs, say, that's one thing; otherwise, yes, it's just another way of insisting that it's different this time. <br><br>On a brighter note, many thanks for the link! Is there any way we can get some lakes like that over here, to swallow up some of the hideous suburban excrescences over here? <br><br>Bill, you're probably right that intrusive exotics are more likely to pick up the slack than new species, though we'll see; the pace at which the eastern coyote seems to be moving toward wolfhood is impressive.

So it's not far to go from coyote to wolf, especially if you mix some domestic dog in (they have more wolf genes and wolf-like social structure). Still, I haven't seen the coyotes in the eastern woodlands developing anywhere near the complex social structure that the wolves that used to live here had. This matters, because adult deer are usually too big for a coyote to take down, but can be prey for a wolf pack. Same for the feral hogs, which have just begun moving into this county in the last couple of years. <br><br>About those hogs, unless we do get wolf-like canines back, we're just stuck with them. People rarely if ever have much luck eradicating them by our own hunting methods. <br><br>About ecological substitutions. Unfortunately, a parrot is not a parrot is not a parrot, and a pigeon is not a pigeon is not a pigeon. The exotic parrots getting established in North America are not really hardy away from houses, and they are not migratory. And every species has its own quirky preferences for food and habitat and its unique social and reproductive behavior. That is why they are all different species. So even if some start to venture into the wilderness, they will be something new, not a replacement for something gone. Passenger Pigeons had a complex social structure and long-range migratory behavior that are unlike their living relatives. <br><br>Selective breeding to create an imitation of an extinct species -- you're very unlikely to recapture the behavior and ecology as well, not just the physical appearance. <br><br>White on birds -- this is not actually all that rare in the wild. If you sort through large flocks of dark birds, you find it pretty often. It can be genetic or developmental. Some birds grow white feathers from healed-up injured parts. I don't know that the incidence of it is really changing. It's more a matter than once you notice one partially leucistic bird, you start looking more closely and discover more of them. <br><br>The squirrels on either side of the Grand Canyon have not necessarily been isolated for the entire time the Canyon has existed. With the climate swings, the Canyon rims have not been squirrel habitat for much of that time, certainly not during the last megadrought. So the present day squirrels are probably descendents of critters that dispersed from the highlands upstream of the canyon within the last &lt;10,000 years as the pines expanded out of the mountains and onto the higher plateaus. Plus, it's not really unfeasible for a squirrel to cross the canyon. Them critters can swim, ya know. And the canyon walls are not unscalable to a squirrel for its entire length. <br><br>And finally, the singular of "species" is "species." There is no such thing as a "specie," at least not in standard English.<br><br><a href=#c3565503019737068653 title="comment permalink">8/4/14, 10:35 PM</a><br><br>

During those five years in Christian Central, there was a killing next door, followed by the firebombing of an auto in the small hours by the relatives of the accused, to encourage them to not testify at the upcoming murder trial (the accused was convicted anyway). The year before I left, one young woman was actually tied up and set on fire over an $850. drug deal (she died in hospital). That lead to the arrest of 6 individuals and reopening of no fewer than 5 previous killings. Law abiding folks not involved in illegal trade were not exempt from theft and violence. I had my car broken into, license plate stolen, garden tools stolen out of my yard while I was answering the phone inside, purse stolen at work. When I moved to the East Coast, the mechanic where I took my car thought it was hilarious that I automatically put a club on my car whenever I parked. My daughter in college in another West Coast state reported that Californians on campus were also obsessively locking their doors and belongings, much to the amusement of others. <br><br>I understand the reason behind high CA crime, which is the desperation caused by the combination of low wages and high cost of living, especially housing costs.

South bay, metro L.A., <br>My impression is that people move/live there for the most superficial of reasons, namely the weather. It's the top reason people give, and the main reason they can't comprehend living anywhere else (too cold, humid, rainy, hot, etc.) I hadn't given much thought to the biome/ecology of the area when I moved there, and it became the main detracting feature for me. I realized I needed green and lushness to thrive, and the arid climate depressed me. I couldn't share this with anyone, as they found it very upsetting. Most of urban/suburban California is such an artificial environment that bears no relation to its natural state. Not to say that there isn't tremendous natural beauty in California, but, for me, day to day, it was an ugly environment.<br>One thing I noticed when I lived there was the pronounced defensiveness and boosterism of the state. Having also lived in Ohio, I recognized it at once: California is" rust belting" as surely as the great lakes states were 30+ years ago. My guess is that many die hard Californians will ignore the warning signs and stay on way too late. Meanwhile, here in central KY, I've met enough California transplants that I'm thinking it's not a coincidence, but it still amazes me, considering I don't think of central KY as a destination for Californians. Meanwhile, I'm very grateful to be back in a rich, diverse biome with lots of lush greenery and ample rainfall throughout the year. :)<br><br><a href=#c6889338710270647127 title="comment permalink">8/5/14, 9:05 AM</a><br><br>

I think doing it on a truly large scale does not make energetic sense and thus cannot be a basis for an industrial society. Albeit South Africa still does it, thanks to have already paid the large sunk cost of setting up the machinery.<br><br>But, as a way to get a not-large amount of liquid fuel, it may make sense, if the liquid fuel is used for a specialized purpose. E.g., as a plaything for the super rich. (Got to keep those exec jest flying, you know.) Or, most likely, for military uses, which is why Germany did it during WW2. Japan went farther, and urged (forced?) a huge number of civilians to roam the woods collecting pine pitch, which they transported to centralized facilities in which they converted it (at great energy expense) to bits of liquid fuel to run the last kamikaze flights.<br><br>Or take the modern-day equivalent. You may have heard of the US Navy coming up with a way to turn seawater into liquid fuel. That's how the energy-clueless journalists say it. I think what they mean is that the US Navy, having nuclear-powered ships a loooong ways from home, thinks it would make sense to use surplus electrical power to electrolize water, and then use chemical processes to convert the hydrogen to liquid fuel. EROI? How cares. It's cheaper than transporting liquid fuel from 10,000 miles away during wartime conditions.<br><br><a href=#c4201966534157102083 title="comment permalink">8/5/14, 7:27 PM</a><br><br>

I grew up and still live in the “Inland Empire” area of southern California. As long as I can remember, this area has mainly been conservative and “traditional”; lot of agriculture and viniculture. However, the ag and vineyards have given way significantly over the years, to the waves of land development. Sadly, only small pockets remain.<br><br>We've had our share of crime here as well. The cartels have had their “representatives” for decades. But, California is not the only place where these things go on. It is part of industrial society, well, actually just part of human ecology I guess. People give in to fear, desperation, insecurities, and lash out violently. There are rude, self-righteous, and self-absorbed people from many places. Again, California does not have a monopoly. But, there are good, kind, and considerate people from all over the world as well, not just California. We find what we are looking for.<br><br>Regarding the sense of living in a war zone, somewhat understandable I guess depending on one's life experiences and expectations. Where I grew up was more along the periphery of the rougher stuff that went on in the LA area. I was in high school in the late 70s, and we had gang members that were essentially new recruits; small, but very marked and definite presence on campus. There was trafficking and extracurricular violence. On average, a couple of these foot soldiers were taken out violently each year. And, there was “collateral damage,” too. Senseless, needless. I’ve struggled with these kinds of things, as well as much of the other sad, ridiculous, unnecessary happenings in other places over the years. Still, there is much good in the world at the same time and there is much beauty to experience wherever we find ourselves, including California.<br><br>In recent years, I’ve found some practices and perspectives that help a lot. Reading the ADR and some of JMG’s books has helped, too. Yes, challenging times no matter where one lives, but in the end we all wind up as worm food, whether by microbes, disease, auto accident, or physical violence of some sort. As JMG pointed out in his post of July 23, we can come to terms with this prospect and face it head on and deal with it productively, or we can live in fear of this prospect and let it have its way with us.<br><br>dies ad bonum est vivere, dies ad bonum est mori<br><br><a href=#c4240378832373186549 title="comment permalink">8/5/14, 10:53 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, many sophisters don't ever get around to pulling them together, but that's not me, I just haven't got the earlier stage over to people yet. And yes, some things cannot be taken apart like that, any more than taking the cat apart to see how it works, but that's where the art comes in in deciding what to separate like that; the merely physical and technical things actually can be separated, so nobody should think I am abstracting out what should be left in.<br><br>So, let's see what you have pulled in that belongs elsewhere than the matters I was looking at.<br><br>"You're using the coal to create a liquid that provides you less energy than if you just burned the coal" - correct, but that's another question. Remember, peak coal - the inherent, internal limitation of this ersatz oil approach - hits later than peak oil, and unevenly in different parts of the world (the brown coal I used as an example is "stranded coal", tied to its area unless and until it is used to produce something that leaves, like electricity).<br><br>"But if you do that in an energy-constrained world (which is what we're talking about here, after all) then you're subtracting net energy from the system".<br><br><i>No</i>, that is <i>not</i> what we're talking about here, that is what we are going to be talking about later (if we do it right), when we pull it all together. Here, we are talking about the run up to a collapse, during which constraints on certain forms of energy are tightening but others are as yet further off - including coal constraints. And it turns out that the bottleneck is not in this coal part, not before other things hit. (There will probably still be brown coal in existence even once people can't get at it any more for other reasons, let alone process it to get ersatz oil, just as there were still Roman aqueducts standing even after people couldn't keep them working - but that just means it's yet other constraints that will hit, and until they do there's an option to push back the oil constraint in at least some places.)<br><br>"Technical feasibility is only the first step. If it is technically feasible, then it's an option, but then economics, politics, culture, etc. gets to fight over the final decision of how to utilize that coal... Therefore, trying to make predictions about the future that work within the current assumptions of rationality are, as often as not, likely to fail. Today's rational decision is not necessarily tomorrow's rational decision, because the context likely will be dramatically different."<br><br>That's what I've been bloody saying. But we won't get past that first step in our analysis - our breaking it all down to have a look at it - for so long as some people think that means that there must be technical feasibility problems that cut in early too, just because other things will provide obstacles. And some people really do think that EROEI must be what stops it, just because it does stop some things; but it's a faulty syllogism other possible causes of things stopping - EROEI stops some things, this will be stopped, so EROEI will stop this.<br><br><a href=#c5011110183972421135 title="comment permalink">8/6/14, 5:17 AM</a><br><br>

Although the area around Charlottesville appears very lush, I was alarmed, and saddened to observe that there are no honeybees at all at my new residence despite a lawn containing clover and several flower bushes in full bloom near the house. Ditto mosquitos at night -- Nada. Two nights ago, I was standing at my friend Bob's door in nearby Maryland, and noticed that there were no nocturnal insects at all buzzing around the door trying to get to the lights inside -- no moths, no mosquitos, no flying bugs, gnats, beetles or any other insect. At my erstwhile home in Idaho, I would have to go through my door at breakneck speed to avoid having to share their company indoors for the rest of the evening. About the only insect I saw an abundance of at my new home were Japanese beetles.<br><br>I also noted a surprising shortage of birds, squirrels, and other creatures that I would expect to find in abundance in such a lush environment.<br><br>I originally grew up in rural Maryland, and distinctly remember the riot of squirrels, raccoons, honeybees, groundhogs, and insects of all kinds.

Most people in America are not heeding the warning signs. Californians aren’t alone.<br><br>Southern California is a semi-arid desert, not sure what you were expecting. I guess deserts are not for the faint of heart. As far as California’s artificial environment, um, there are 38 million people in the state and yes, it has been highly modified by humans, what did you expect? It’s not as represented in the advertisements or the movies, but then nothing is.<br><br>I guess a lot of people have come to southern California for the mostly sunny weather. I’ve heard that a few times from some people and most are glad they did. My parents came here as children with their parents, who came here from the Midwest for work after WWII. Booming aerospace and defense industries among other things.<br><br>Seems that some people are anxious to dance on California’s grave. But, I’m going to stay here. I know what to expect about most things and where things are. At the same time, I’m heeding the Archdruid’s advice and reading up on local ecology and natural history, etc.<br><br>Regardless of what happens, there will be plenty to salvage. In the valley areas of southern California, there are still good, fertile soils that can be utilized, though some “undeveloping” may be required. Whatever is done, it will be done in comfortable sunny weather. Freezing to death won’t be a big worry. Yes, water will be the defining challenge and I expect there will be actual out-and-out water wars rather than just the courtroom variety. I expect that Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Tucson will become ghost towns before LA or San Diego. But, to paraphrase what JMG has said repeatedly…things are going to get rather messy everywhere. Whatever the case, life has a 100% mortality rate. So, I’m going to focus on enjoying the ride and preserving what I can. <br><br>Best regards.<br><br><a href=#c2081890252241916021 title="comment permalink">8/6/14, 12:28 PM</a><br><br>
